# Discord Bot--Mattbot Music Bot

First ever discord bot, and first JavaScript project! The basics of this app follows Niconiconii's (https://www.youtube.com/c/Niconiconii/videos) discord bot tutorials, 
which I used to learn how to use the Discord.js library as well as other basics of Discord bot creation and JavaScript. Once I understood the basics, I used my newfound 
knowledge to create additional commands as well as cleanup any spaghetti code. The main part is that it includes a completely functional music player which allows for 
pausing, skipping, seeking, queueing songs and playlists, and more music functions!
  
This bot allows users to play music and playlists from any streaming service such as Spotify, YouTube, Soundcloud, and more, in their Discord servers so others in Voice 
Channels can socialize while also having a bit of background music ðŸ˜Ž. If one doesn't have a link to the song/playlist they want, they can always use the bot to search 
as if they were searching directly on YouTube!

In the future, I plan to implement Spotify's API to allow users to save and create playlists with the bot, as well as use the Genius Lyrics' API for lyric generation.
